# kareila/aoc-solutions

I participated in the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about)
for the first time in 2022 and enjoyed it quite a bit. I decided to share
my solutions here, which were all programmed in Perl 5 without using any
[CPAN](https://www.cpan.org/) modules. I have been a Perl programmer
for more than 20 years and it's the language I know best. I got the
impression from lurking on various popular internet forums that not
many AoC participants were using Perl, so I thought that my solutions
might be of interest to fellow Perl programmers.

Based on what I learned from that experience, I decided to teach myself the
[Elixir language](https://elixir-lang.org/docs.html) using the excellent
[Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/elixir/about) website. Once I
finished that syllabus, I decided to gain further practice by reimplementing
some of my AoC solutions in Elixir, which I am also sharing here. It seems
to me that Elixir scripts take longer to start up than Perl scripts, but
once they get going, they can resolve large computations faster, especially
on exercises that can be solved with asynchronous parallel calculations.

I have not included my input files here, because it is my understanding that
it is frowned upon to do so, and my scripts will quit with an error saying
that the input file was not found. You will need to either download your own
inputs from the AoC site (which requires an account), or create a workaround
if you want to run my code as-is using the examples provided in each puzzle's
description on the AoC site.

Have fun saving Christmas!


Changes
-------

### 28 Dec 2023

Finalized my solutions for the 2023 Advent of Code. These were written
in Elixir and none take more than 5 seconds to execute on my machine.
(Only Day 23 takes more than 3 seconds.)


### 7 Oct 2023

Updated the 2021-2022 Elixir solutions to use the shared libraries.
I think I'm finally done with revisions on these - I kept coming back
because I enjoyed writing code in Elixir so much.


### 4 Oct 2023

Finished Elixir versions of my solutions for the 2020 exercises.
Now I have Elixir code for 2017-2022 and Perl code for 2020-2022.


### 27 Sep 2023

Updated the 2017-2019 Elixir solutions to use shared libraries of
common functions. Also finally figured out how to use the Intcode
input data as a map instead of a linked list, resulting in a huge
speed boost - as much as 10x in some exercises.


### 26 Sep 2023

Solved exercises for 2017 using Elixir. Elapsed time: only 5 days??


### 20 Sep 2023

Took 7 days to write Elixir versions of my solutions for 2021.


### 13 Sep 2023

Solved exercises for 2018 using Elixir. Elapsed time: 11 days exactly.


### 30 Aug 2023

Solved exercises for 2019 using Elixir. Whoa, we're halfway there.


### 27 Apr 2023

Published Elixir versions of my solutions for the 2022 exercises.


### 23 Jan 2023

Completed Perl solutions for 2021. Three years down, five to go...


### 6 Jan 2023

Finished Perl solutions for 2020. (It's the twelfth day of Christmas!)


### 27 Dec 2022

Initial release of Perl solutions from 2022.
