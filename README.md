# kareila/aoc-solutions

I participated in the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about)
for the first time in 2022 and enjoyed it quite a bit. I decided to share
my solutions here, which were all programmed in Perl 5 without using any
[CPAN](https://www.cpan.org/) modules. I have been a Perl programmer
for more than 20 years and it's the language I know best. I got the
impression from lurking on various popular internet forums that not
many AoC participants were using Perl, so I thought that my solutions
might be of interest to fellow Perl programmers.

Based on what I learned from that experience, I decided to teach myself the
[Elixir language](https://elixir-lang.org/docs.html) using the excellent
[Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/elixir/about) website. Once I
finished that syllabus, I decided to gain further practice by reimplementing
some of my AoC solutions in Elixir, which I am also sharing here. It seems
to me that Elixir scripts take longer to start up than Perl scripts, but
once they get going, they can resolve large computations faster, especially
on exercises that can be solved with asynchronous parallel calculations.

I have not included my input files here, because it is my understanding that
it is frowned upon to do so, and my scripts will quit with an error saying
that the input file was not found. You will need to either download your own
inputs from the AoC site (which requires an account), or create a workaround
if you want to run my code as-is using the examples provided in each puzzle's
description on the AoC site.

Have fun saving Christmas!
