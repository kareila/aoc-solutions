# kareila/aoc-solutions

I participated in the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about)
for the first time in 2022 and enjoyed it quite a bit. I decided to share my solutions
here, which are all programmed in Perl 5 without using any CPAN modules - although you
might see some commented-out uses of Data::Dumper in places where I was inspecting the
values of variables as I worked on my implementations.

Anyway, I love Perl 5; I've been programming in it for more than 20 years and it's
the language I know best. It doesn't seem like many AoC participants were using it,
so I thought my solutions might be of interest to fellow Perl programmers.

I have not included my input files here, because it is my understanding that it is
frowned upon to do so, and my scripts will quit with an error saying that the input
file was not found. You will need to either download your own inputs from the AoC site
(which requires an account), or create a workaround if you want to run my code as-is
using the examples provided in each puzzle's description.

Have fun saving Christmas!
